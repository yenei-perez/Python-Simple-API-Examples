# Python-Simple-API-Examples
In this mini lab, we will be practicing loading and using data from simple, open-source APIs. 

After completing this lab you will be able to

Load and use RandomUser API, using RandomUser() Python library

Load and use Fruityvice API, using requests Python library

Load and use Open-Joke-API, using requests Python library

The purpose of this notebook is to provide more examples on how to use simple APIs. As you may already know, API stands for Application Programming Interface and is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.

One of the applications we will use in this notebook is Random User Generator. RandomUser is an open-source, free API providing developers with randomly generated users to be used as placeholders for testing purposes. This makes the tool similar to Lorem Ipsum, but is a placeholder for people instead of text. The API can return multiple results, as well as specify generated user details such as gender, email, image, username, address, title, first and last name, and more. More information on RandomUser can be found here.

Another example of simple API we will use in this notebook is Fruityvice application. The Fruityvice API web service which provides data for all kinds of fruit! You can use Fruityvice to find out interesting information about fruit and educate yourself. The web service is completely free to use and contribute to.
